## Set up

### Requirements

- [PHP >= 7.2.5](https://www.php.net/) and [composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
- A Twilio account - [sign up](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio)

### Twilio Account Settings

This application should give you a ready-made starting point for writing your own application.
Before we begin, we need to collect all the config values we need to run the application:

| Config&nbsp;Value | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Account&nbsp;Sid  | Your primary Twilio account identifier - find this [in the Console](https://www.twilio.com/console).                                                         |
| Phone&nbsp;number | A Twilio phone number in [E.164 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) - you can [get one here](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/incoming) |
| App&nbsp;Sid | The TwiML application with a voice URL configured to access your server running this app - create one [in the console here](https://www.twilio.com/console/voice/twiml/apps). Also, you will need to configure the Voice "REQUEST URL" on the TwiML app once you've got your server up and running. |
| API Key / API Secret | Your REST API Key information needed to create an [Access Token](https://www.twilio.com/docs/iam/access-tokens) - create [one here](https://www.twilio.com/console/project/api-keys). |

### Create a TwiML App

This project is configured to use a **TwiML App**, which allows us to easily set the voice URLs for all Twilio phone numbers we purchase in this app.

Create a new TwiML app at https://www.twilio.com/console/voice/twiml/apps and use its `Sid` as the `TWILIO_APPLICATION_SID` environment variable wherever you run this app.

Once you have created your TwiML app, configure your Twilio phone number to use it ([instructions here](https://www.twilio.com/help/faq/twilio-client/how-do-i-create-a-twiml-app)).

If you don't have a Twilio phone number yet, you can purchase a new number in your [Twilio Account Dashboard](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/phone-numbers/incoming).

### Local development

After the above requirements have been met:

1. Clone this repository and `cd` into it

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:TwilioDevEd/browser-calls-laravel.git
    cd browser-calls-laravel
    ```

1. Install PHP dependencies

    ```bash
    make install
    ```

1. Set your environment variables

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    See [Twilio Account Settings](#twilio-account-settings) to locate the necessary environment variables.

1. Install Node dependencies
    ```bash
    npm install 
    ```

1. Build the frontend assets
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

1. Run the application

    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

1. Run the application

    ```bash
    make serve
    ```

1. Expose the application to the wider Internet using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)

   ```bash
   $ ngrok http 8000
   ```
   Once you have started ngrok, update your TwiML app's voice URL setting to use your ngrok hostname, so it will look something like this:

   ```
   https://<your-ngrok-subdomain>.ngrok.io/support/call
   ```

1. To create a support ticket go to the home page.
   On this page you could fill some fields and create a ticket or you can call to support.

   ```
   https://<your-ngrok-subdomain>.ngrok.io
   ```

   __Note:__ Make sure you use the `https` version of your ngrok URL as some
   browsers won't allow access to the microphone unless you are using a secure
   SSL connection.

1. To respond to support tickets go to the `dashboard` page (you should open two windows or tabs).
   On this page you could call customers and answers phone calls.

   ```
   https://<your-ngrok-subdomain>.ngrok.io/dashboard
   ```

    That's it!

### Unit and Integration Tests

You can run the Unit and Feature tests locally by typing:
```bash
php artisan test
```

### Cloud deployment

Additionally to trying out this application locally, you can deploy it to a variety of host services. Here is a small selection of them.

Please be aware that some of these might charge you for the usage or might make the source code for this application visible to the public. When in doubt research the respective hosting service first.

| Service                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
